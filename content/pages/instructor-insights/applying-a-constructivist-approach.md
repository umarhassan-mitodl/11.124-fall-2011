_In this section, Prof. Klopfer outlines his constructivist approach to teaching and explains the details of how students learn from experience in a video interview._

Enabling Students to Learn Through Experience
---------------------------------------------

I use a constructivist approach in my classes; I believe that learning happens not from me telling things to students, but from them experiencing things. By incorporating large amounts of discussion- and activity-based time into this class, I aimed to provide opportunities for my students to learn through experience.

Two prime examples of the constructivist approach in action are the current events assignment ({{% resource_link f7ca8dc8-2e3f-3045-44a1-cc372afc7191 "PDF" %}}) and the chapter readings assignment ({{% resource_link 1a1d94ad-c888-cdd4-c19c-07d897e2e45c "PDF" %}}), which are described in more detail {{% resource_link 2bddb4c1-767a-fcd3-7dc5-eb0585c90151 "here" %}}. Another example is the {{% resource_link fe849a17-d4db-501a-ffdc-dc517b8137c0 "modes of teaching activity" %}}, in which students learned about and experienced various educational strategies by teaching their own lessons to their classmates.
